# XAPP-V12-01 · Both — Final cross-app isolation and launch-consistency review

**Run after:** SC-V12-08 (this repo) and MW-V12-09 (Mellowa repo).
**Primary risk removed:** Scalvya and Mellowa share operational providers; a fix in one app can
still leak events, email or release assumptions into the other.

## Prompt

Perform a read-only-first cross-app review of primocera/LaunchBloom and primocera/Mellowa at
their newly frozen candidate SHAs. Make only focused regression-test or documentation fixes; any
product-code change invalidates the affected candidate and requires re-freezing.

Cross-app checks:
1. Stripe: each app allowlists only its own product and price IDs; foreign events are ignored
   safely; no foreign event creates entitlement, subscription rows, failure alerts or email;
   webhook idempotency keys cannot collide across products.
2. Email: sender identities and unsubscribe domains are correct per app; optional suppression
   never crosses brands; transactional messages cannot be triggered by foreign events.
3. Auth/Supabase: callback URLs, site URLs and redirect allowlists are app-specific; E2E projects
   and marker guards cannot target production or the other app.
4. Analytics: event namespaces do not collide; no sensitive campaign or wellbeing content is
   captured; build/app identifiers allow accurate separation.
5. Production configuration: readiness checks validate the correct brand, domains, prices and
   provider configuration; no secret values are printed.
6. Commercial content: both apps state the same trial mechanics accurately where their offers are
   equivalent; each app's price, currency, renewal and cancellation wording matches its own
   Stripe catalog; neither app inherits the other app's claims or audience.
7. Release truth: evidence is pinned to the correct repository and candidate; accepted risks
   produce CONDITIONAL GO rather than full GO; no historical or superseded document is presented
   as current.

Add symmetric regression fixtures: a Mellowa event sent to Scalvya and a Scalvya event sent to
Mellowa. Both must be acknowledged without side effects.

If any code changes, invalidate and re-cut only the affected candidate. End with a two-column
final report: Scalvya status, Mellowa status, shared risks, owner-only actions and whether paid
acquisition may safely expand.
